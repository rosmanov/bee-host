- Get rid of patch-manifest.pl. Write a C program instead (we already have
  dependenciesi on json-builder and json-parser, so no need in extra dependencies on Perl and its JSON/JSON::XS module or others)
  (!!!! Maybe just use CMake's configuration files *.in for the different kinds
  of manifests ?! We should have the user's intentions before building the app)

- Use cJSON ( https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON ) instead of udp/json-builder
  and udp/json-parser
